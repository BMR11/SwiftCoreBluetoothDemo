# Swift Core Bluetooth Demo

This repository contains the **complete working demos** used in the [San Diego iOS Developers](https://www.meetup.com/sdiosdevelopers/) talk: **["Interfacing with Bluetooth Devices in Swift"](https://www.meetup.com/sdiosdevelopers/events/310565470/?eventOrigin=group_calendar)** presented on September 9th, 2025.

## üéØ What This Demo Contains

This is a **hands-on demonstration** of Apple's Core Bluetooth framework in Swift, showing how **iOS and macOS devices communicate with each other and with Nordic nRF52 development boards** using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

The demos illustrate **real-world BLE connectivity patterns** with working code you can run, modify, and learn from.

## üõ† Requirements
- Xcode 15+  
- Swift 5.0+  
- iOS 17.5+ / macOS 14.5+  
- Bluetooth Low Energy enabled hardware  
- (Optional) Nordic nRF52 Development Kit with Light Button Service

## üñ•Ô∏è Supported Platforms
- **iOS**: iPhone, iPad (Central or Peripheral)
- **macOS**: MacBook, iMac (Central or Peripheral)
- **Cross-platform**: Any combination of iOS/macOS devices can communicate  

---

## üöÄ Quick Start - Run the Live Demo

1. **Clone and open** the project in Xcode:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BMR11/SwiftCoreBluetoothDemo.git
cd SwiftCoreBluetoothDemo
open SwiftCoreBluetoothDemo.xcodeproj
```

2. **Run both apps** on different devices/simulators:
   - **MyCoreBluetoothDemo** (Central) - Run on iPhone/iPad/Mac
   - **MyPeripheral** (Peripheral) - Run on another iPhone/iPad/Mac

3. **Test the LBS connection**:
   - **Option A - iOS/macOS Peripheral**: Start the Peripheral app first (it will begin advertising LBS service)
   - **Option B - nRF52 DK Peripheral**: Flash the nRF52 DK with Nordic's LBS sample code
   - Start the Central app and tap "Start Scan"
   - Connect to the discovered peripheral
   - Press/release the button on peripheral and see it reflected on central
   - Toggle the LED on central and see it controlled on peripheral!

### üîß Using nRF52 DK as LBS Peripheral
If you have a Nordic nRF52 Development Kit:
1. **Flash the LBS sample** to your nRF52 DK using nRF Connect SDK
2. **Build and run** the [`peripheral_lbs` sample](https://docs.nordicsemi.com/bundle/ncs-latest/page/nrf/samples/bluetooth/peripheral_lbs/README.html#peripheral-lbs) from Nordic's examples
3. **The nRF52 will advertise** the LBS service automatically
4. **Use the Central app** to connect and interact with the physical hardware
5. **Press the physical button** on the nRF52 to see it reflected in the Central app
6. **Toggle the LED** in the Central app to control the physical LED on the nRF52

## üí° Perfect for Learning
- **Production-ready code** you can study and modify
- **Complete BLE implementation** from scanning to data exchange
- **Modern SwiftUI interfaces** with proper error handling
- **Nordic nRF52 LBS service** - standard for embedded device communication
- **Real-world patterns** used in IoT and embedded device applications
