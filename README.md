# Swift Core Bluetooth Demo

This repository contains **practical demos** using Apple‚Äôs Core Bluetooth framework in Swift.  
The focus is on showing how **iOS and macOS devices communicate with each other and with Nordic nRF52 development boards** using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

These are not step-by-step tutorials ‚Äî they are **connectivity demos** that illustrate how Central and Peripheral roles work in real-world scenarios.

## üîë Demos Included

### 1. iOS as Central
- iOS app built with **CBCentralManager** in Swift.
- Connects to:
  - **Mac Peripheral Manager** (simulated BLE peripheral).
  - **Nordic nRF52 Development Kit** running the **Light Button Service (LBS)**.
- Demo shows:
  - Scanning & connecting to peripherals.
  - Discovering services & characteristics.
  - Reading, writing, and subscribing to notifications.

### 2. Mac as Central
- macOS app using **Core Bluetooth Central Manager**.
- Connects to:
  - **iOS Peripheral Manager** (Swift-based).
  - **Nordic nRF52 Dev Board** (LBS service).
- Demo shows:
  - Multi-device connectivity.
  - Real-time updates from peripherals.
  - Data exchange between Mac, iOS, and embedded devices.
