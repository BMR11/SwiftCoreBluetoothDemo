# Swift Core Bluetooth Demo

This repository contains **practical demos** using Apple‚Äôs Core Bluetooth framework in Swift.  
The focus is on showing how **iOS and macOS devices communicate with each other and with Nordic nRF52 development boards** using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).

These are not step-by-step tutorials ‚Äî they are **connectivity demos** that illustrate how Central and Peripheral roles work in real-world scenarios.
This was presented at [San Diego iOS Developers](https://www.meetup.com/sdiosdevelopers/), as part of [Interfacing with Bluetooth Devices in Swift](https://www.meetup.com/sdiosdevelopers/events/310565470/?eventOrigin=group_calendar) talk on September 9th, 2025.
